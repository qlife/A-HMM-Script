This program depends on:
    -- python2.6 or higher
    -- logilab.hmm module

And logilab.hmm module depends on:
    -- Mercurial (for grabing out files)
    -- numpy
    -- gcc
    -- gfortran (or any other fortarn compiler supported by setup.py)

INSTALL

    To do a typical (userland) installation of logilab.hmm:

        $ apt-get install python python-dev python-numpy gfortran mercurial

        $ hg clone http://hg.logilab.org/logilab/hmm

    Then we'll have the installation script setup.py in hmm.

        $ cd hmm/
        $ python setup.py install -user

    To test if installation is finished you may do the following steps:

        $ python
        from logilab.hmm import HMM

    No news is good news.

    I haven't done this on Windows platform. Theorically, you'll need mingw,
    a supported fortarn compiler and sci-py package.
